# AppSecurity

This project is a simple interface that hit the SQL DB backend to help IT Admins determine what AD groups users needed to b e a member of in order to be given access to certain web applications.

This was an ASP.Net project because previously we were using ASP to grab the username of the logged on windows user for security reasons. That was in process of being replaced buy the LaunchPad with the AD Auth Login.
